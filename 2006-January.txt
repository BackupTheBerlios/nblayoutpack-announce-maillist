Subject: [nblayoutpack-announce] [ANN] NetBeans Layout Pack in NetBeans 5.0 - sad news
Message-ID: <43DCD0B8.9050205@gmail.com>

Hi,

It's sad but it's true - NetBeans Layout Pack's modules won't work in 
NetBeans 5.0 as it will be released. So, stick with NetBeans 5.0 beta 2 
or whatever build you use for form editing until further announcement.

I have filed a bug (see 
http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=71836) which had been 
fixed in development trunk. I've got the following comment from Tomas 
Pavek (he fixed the bug, BTW) also:
Now - the fix is easy in NetBeans, but there is no workaround on your 
side</span>. It's a shame this is broken in 5.0, but it is far too late 
to get the fix into the release. I can only think about creating a patch 
for you, possibly making it available later as hotfix on AU.

Let's ask for a hotfix for NetBeans 5.0!
