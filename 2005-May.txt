Subject: [nblayoutpack-announce] On the future of NetBeans Layout Pack - NetBeans 4.1and beyond
Message-ID: <4293725E.7050505@gmail.com>

Hello!

It have been a long time since I've posted an announcement regarding 
NetBeans Layout Pack - more than 4 months. But I'm still here and I'm 
working on NetBeans 4.1 support right now. There are some issues because 
of changes introduced by NB's team so it will take some time. Please, be 
patient.

I'm going to publish source code when NB 4.1 support will be finished.

Subject: [nblayoutpack-announce] [ANN] TableLayout and FormLayout supporting modules for NetBeans
 updated
Message-ID: <42964B2A.8070105@gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm proud to announce immediate availablity of supporting modules for
TableLayout and FormLayout layout managers.
NetBeans 3.6, 4.0, and 4.1 are supported.

Modules available for download from
https://developer.berlios.de/projects/nblayoutpack/

This release introduces incompatible changes - previous releases won't
be able to load forms created with this release. Those changes were
required to match recent changes in NetBeans 4.1 codebase regarding
class loaders separation.

In case of problems with loading of forms created with previous releases
you can update .form files by hand as described below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual form updating for TableLayout.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open form in NetBeans BEFORE module update. Note the values of columns
and rows properties of TableLayout. Close form.
Open .form file in text editor. For each layout manager instance search
for following line:
<Value type="[D"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.tablelayout.TableLayoutSupport$DoubleArrayEditor">

Replace that and next line (starting with <SerializedValue ...>)
- for columns property:
<Value type="[D"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.tablelayout.TableLayoutSupport$ColumnsEditor">
    <Columns value="!!!string value of Columns property!!!"/>

- for rows property:
<Value type="[D"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.tablelayout.TableLayoutSupport$RowsEditor">
    <Rows value="!!!string value of Rows property!!!"/>
You can decide which lines to insert by inspecting CodeMethod name value
   located 5 lines above the '<Value type="[D"' line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual form updating for FormLayout.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open form in NetBeans BEFORE module update. Note the values of column
groups and row groups properties of FormLayout. Note the values of
horizontal alignment and vertical alignment layout properties for each
component. Close form.
Open .form file in text editor. For each layout manager instance search
for following lines:

a)
<Value type="[[I"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.formlayout.editors.ColumnGroupsEditor">

Replace next line (starting with <SerializedValue ...>) with following:
<Groups value="!!!string value of Column groups property!!!"/>

b)
<Value type="[[I"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.formlayout.editors.RowGroupsEditor">

Replace next line (starting with <SerializedValue ...>) with following:
<Groups value="!!!string value of Row groups property!!!"/>

For each component search for following lines:

a)
<Value type="com.jgoodies.forms.layout.CellConstraints$Alignment"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.formlayout.editors.HAlignEditor">

Replace next line (starting with <SerializedValue ...>) with following:
<HAlign value="!!!string value of Horizontal alignment property
                 (in lowercase)!!!"/>

b)
<Value type="com.jgoodies.forms.layout.CellConstraints$Alignment"
editor="de.berlios.nblayoutpack.formlayout.editors.VAlignEditor">

Replace next line (starting with <SerializedValue ...>) with following:
<VAlign value="!!!string value of Vertical alignment property
                 (in lowercase)!!!"/>

If you think it's too cumbersome to note alignment properties for each
component then you can set all values to "default" and then edit them
visually in form editor.

PS: I recommend to backup .form files before updating.
